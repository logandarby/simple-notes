# Simple Notes

A full-stack implementation of a notes app.

The goal with this project was to completely conceptualize the stack, architechure and UI design from the ground up before implementation.

## Running

First, make sure you have Docker installed and running. Run `docker-compose up` in the root server to start the database.

Second, make sure you have `yarn` installed, as well a global install of `ts-node` and `concurrently`. Run `yarn run dev` in the root folder. This will start the API and the Client. The website should open in your default browser.
